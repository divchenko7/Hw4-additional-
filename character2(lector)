-Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to present our new AI assistant - Filya. He’s here to make sure you don’t fall asleep in my lectures.
- Attend classes for you? Why? And for what?
-(raising an eyebrow)

-(laughing) So, you want Filya to be your personal lecture assistant and your entertainment filter?
-Nice try) But I think learning to manage your schedule and stay awake in all your classes is part of the experience here.
-True, but imagine the chaos if everyone had a robot.

-For now, you’ll have to put up with my humor. Welcome to the Kyiv School of Economics—where learning is always an adventure!
