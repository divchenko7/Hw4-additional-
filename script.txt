-Can you believe that AI grading our exam papers? What’s next,we have a robot TA?
-Good morning, everyone. Today, I want to present our new AI assistant - Filya. He’s here to make sure you don’t fall asleep in my lectures.
-This robot is incredible! Professor, can I get one to attend my classes for me?
- Attend classes for you? Why? And for what?
-Well, I have some classes that overlap, and I always miss out on something important.
-(raising an eyebrow)
-If Filya could go to the boring ones for me, listen, and then summarize the key points, I wouldn’t have to choose.
it is cringe
-Plus, I wouldn’t have to struggle to stay awake in the dull ones.
-(laughing) So, you want Filya to be your personal lecture assistant and your entertainment filter?
-Exactly! He could take notes, and then I could focus on the classes I actually find interesting.
-Nice try) But I think learning to manage your schedule and stay awake in all your classes is part of the experience here.
-I thought it was worth a shot. Besides, Filya wouldn’t complain about taking my place.
-True, but imagine the chaos if everyone had a robot.
-It would definitely be a sight. So, no robot stand-ins for us, huh?
gosh no way
-Fine, but if Filya ever learns to crack jokes, I’m signing up for his class.
-For now, you’ll have to put up with my humor. Welcome to the Kyiv School of Economics—where learning is always an adventure!
