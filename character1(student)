-Can you believe that AI grading our exam papers? What’s next,we have a robot TA?
-This robot is incredible! Professor, can I get one to attend my classes for me?
-Well, I have some classes that overlap, and I always miss out on something important.
-If Filya could go to the boring ones for me, listen, and then summarize the key points, I wouldn’t have to choose.
-Plus, I wouldn’t have to struggle to stay awake in the dull ones.
-Exactly! He could take notes, and then I could focus on the classes I actually find interesting.
-I thought it was worth a shot. Besides, Filya wouldn’t complain about taking my place.
-It would definitely be a sight. So, no robot stand-ins for us, huh?
-Fine, but if Filya ever learns to crack jokes, I’m signing up for his class.
